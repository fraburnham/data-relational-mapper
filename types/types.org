* Types

** Rules and assumptions

   * Types are intended to handle database level concerns
     * Managing relationships
     * Serialize/deserialize
     * Prepare query map fragments

** Interface Definition

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle interface.py
     # not sure imports belong in here for literate reasons, seems like the
     # tangler should round them up and put them at the top of a tangled file
     from abc import abstractmethod
