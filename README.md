# Data Relational Mapping

[Literate Entrypoint](main-flow.org)

An experiment with an alternative to Object Relational Mapping. On the surface this appears to be a desireable goal because data can be more flexible/composable. 
It also encourages keeping functionality away from the models themselves. This should allow the models to more accurately represent their domain without being 
directly aware of real world circumstances.
