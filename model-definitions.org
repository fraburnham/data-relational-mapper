* Model Definitions

** Rules and assumptions

   * A model's definition must only depend on the field types and any validators. These constraints should prevent any need for circular dependancies in the models themselves.
   * A type (or fn) that implements a known interface is used as the `:type` value. This allows custom type behavior (like implementing new relationships or serializing types
     to something suitable for the database). (N.B.: Types may require an interface or map of fns to implement a default validator/options selector)
   * Each field may have only one validator function that receives the value of that field.
   * Each model may have only one validator function that receives the values of the model.
   * Validators do not mutate or transform. They only approve or deny values.
   * Models must be registered in some way so the DRM can find the data.
   * A model may specify the behavior of it's fk children upon it's deletion (perhaps also on update?) via the chosen fk type.

** Registering

   Registering should only require the user to pass the model dict to a fn. The fn can store the information somewhere. Perhaps a closure? An object is more typical.
   It wouldn't be an issue to store the models in an object for persistance, but it would be no different to return an object w/ the data vs a closure.
