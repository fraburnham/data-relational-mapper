* Validators

** Rules and assumptions

   * A validator receives as little as it can to validate
     * For a field validator this means a value
     * For a model validator this means the model
   * Maintaining relationships is not a validators responsibility

** Examples
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def tos_check(query_map):
         pass

     def max_length(maximum):
         return lambda x: len(x) > maximum

   #+END_SRC

*** TODO The `tos_check` can't be written until there is more known about the query map structure and sql generation flow
